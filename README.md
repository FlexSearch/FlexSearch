FlexSearch is a high performance REST/SOAP services based full-text searching platform built on top of the popular Lucene search library.  At its core it is about extensibility and maintainability with minimum overhead. 
FlexSearch is written in F# & C# 5.0 (.net framework 4.6). It exposes REST, SOAP and Binary based web service endpoints enabling easy integration. It has an extensive plug-in architecture with ability to customize most of the functionality with minimum amount of efforts. One area where FlexSearch particularly excel over competition is providing easy extensible connector model which allows a developer to tap directly into coreâ€™s indexing engine, thus avoiding the reliance on web services. This results in a greatly improved indexing performance when indexing over millions of records.
